| Factory Method Design Pattern - Social Network Example
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| This example demonstrates the Factory Method Design Pattern, allowing for 
| dynamic creation of different types of social network connectors (e.g., 
| Facebook, LinkedIn) without specifying the exact class to instantiate.

|
| Key Components:
| 1. SocialNetworkPoster (Abstract Class): Declares the factory method 
|    `getSocialNetwork` that returns a SocialNetworkConnector. Includes common 
|    logic for posting content to a social network.
| 2. Concrete Social Network Posters: Implement the factory method to create 
|    specific connectors like FacebookConnector and LinkedInConnector.
| 3. SocialNetworkConnector (Interface): Defines the behavior of social 
|    network connectors, including methods like `logIn`, `logOut`, and 
|    `createPost`.
| 4. Concrete Social Network Connectors: Implement the SocialNetworkConnector 
|    interface for specific platforms (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn).
| 5. Client Code: Works with SocialNetworkPoster via its abstract interface, 
|    enabling flexibility and decoupling from concrete implementations.
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Use Case:
| Use the Factory Method pattern when the application needs to support 
| multiple types of social network integrations without hardcoding the 
| specifics of each connector. This approach promotes scalability and adherence 
| to the open/closed principle.
